# Floating D20

## Introduction

Floating D20 is a simple Android application that displays a rotating 20-sided die (d20) that dynamically responds to the phone's orientation using its internal sensors. The app provides a visually engaging and interactive experience, simulating a physical d20 that moves in response to how the phone is held and tilted.  It has been designed to be a simple, but fun application that anyone can enjoy.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Rotation:** The d20 smoothly rotates in response to the device's orientation, providing a realistic and engaging experience.
*   **Sensor-Driven:** Utilizes the device's accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to detect changes in orientation and accurately reflect them in the d20's movement.
*   **Simple Design:** Features a clean and minimalist design with a black background and a centered grey d20, making it visually appealing and easy to use.
*   **Personalized Display:** Displays the name "LAM" prominently at the bottom of the screen.
*   **Custom App Icon:** Uses a unique black and white checker pattern for the app icon, making it stand out on the user's home screen.
* **Lightweight**: The app is lightweight and simple, making it easy to install and run, even on older hardware.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   An Android device or emulator running Android API level 26 or higher.
    *   Android Studio installed on your development machine (recommended for building from source).
    *  A JDK correctly installed on your device.

2.  **Building from Source (Recommended):**
    *   Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    *   Open Android Studio.

    *   Connect your Android device or start an emulator.
    *   Click the "Run" button (green play icon) to build and install the app on your device or emulator.

3.  **Installing from an APK (Alternative):**
    *   If you have access to a pre-built APK file (e.g., `app-debug.apk`), you can install it directly on your Android device.
    *   Ensure that your device allows installations from "Unknown Sources" (this setting is usually found under "Security" or "Apps" in your device settings).
    *   Transfer the APK file to your device (via USB, cloud storage, etc.).
    *   Use a file manager app on your device to navigate to the APK file.
    *   Tap the APK file to start the installation process.
    *   Follow the on-screen instructions to install the app.

## Usage

1.  **Launch the App:** Find the "Floating D20" app icon (the black and white checker pattern) on your device's home screen or app drawer, and tap it to launch the app.
2.  **Observe the D20:** You will see a grey d20 in the center of a black background.
3.  **Interact:** Tilt, rotate, and move your phone to see the d20 respond to your device's orientation. The d20 will rotate smoothly in the corresponding direction.
4.  **"LAM" Display:** Notice the "LAM" text displayed at the bottom of the screen.
